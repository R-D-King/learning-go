# Learning Go Programming Language

This repo is for practicing and exploring the go programming language.
There should be separate branches for every source I'm learning from.

[get-programming-with-go](./get-programmin-with-go) is the exercises and experiments done while learning and following the book by the same name.
It's a book about the basics and suitable for new programmers in general.

[snippetbox](./snippetbox) is a project done while following the book "Let's Go".
In this book we’ll be building a web application called Snippetbox, which lets people paste and share snippets of text — a bit like Pastebin or GitHub’s Gists.

[go_for_beginers](./go_for_beginners) is a project done while following [Go for Absolute Beginners – Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akosxcqJorU&t=13175s)
not the best for building a strong foundation.
but was a good introduction to the language's most used features (like the net/http package, logging, error handling)
