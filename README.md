# Learning Go Programming Language

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning and exploring the Go programming language. It serves as a collection of exercises, projects, and experiments from various learning resources.

**Current Focus:** Actively working through the "get-programming-with-go" exercises and exploring web development with "snippetbox".

## Repository Structure & Learning Paths

This repository is organized into different directories, each corresponding to a specific learning resource or project. I aim to maintain separate branches for each learning source to keep the progress organized.

### Learning Resources:

*   **[Get Programming with Go](./get-programmin-with-go)**: This directory contains exercises and experiments from the book "Get Programming with Go". It focuses on the basics and is suitable for new programmers.
*   **[Snippetbox Web Application](./snippetbox)**: This project is built while following the book "Let's Go". Snippetbox is a web application designed for pasting and sharing text snippets, similar to Pastebin or GitHub Gists.
*   **[Go for Absolute Beginners Tutorial](./go_for_beginners)**: These are notes and code from the "[Go for Absolute Beginners – Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akosxcqJorU&t=13175s)" YouTube series. While perhaps not ideal for building a strong foundational understanding, it provided a good introduction to commonly used Go features like the `net/http` package, logging, and error handling.
